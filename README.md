This problem was harder than I expected, and took more hours than expected to solve. And I think my solution was not good, in this solution I used a while
but earlier I solved with 2 for loops, but in some tests I was getting "Time Limit Exceeded", so was not performatic at all. But at least I solved, I certainly can improve this code.
